## What is the RE5?

The RE5 is a macropad with only 5 push button rotary encoders. I designed this to be used as a framing square.
I named it RE5 because the shape is similar to katakana "レ" and it has 5 knobs.

## Why open source?

I made it open source so that anyone interested in self-made keyboard could try easily.
